# Cypress Starter Template

This is a template to quickly get you started on E2E testing with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). It comes with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) out of the box, and includes [Cypress Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro/) that help you write good-practice queries. All typing are pre-configured for you, so you get great code-suggestion support from modern IDEs (like Visual Studio Code).

## Features

‚≠êÔ∏è Cypress 10
‚≠êÔ∏è TypeScript 4.7.3
‚≠êÔ∏è Cypress Testing Library 8.0.3

## Installation

Clone this repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thanhsonng/cypress-starter.git <your-folder-name>
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Run Cypress

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

üéâ Done. You can now start writing your first test suite.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: By default, it uses Chrome as the default browser, and it directly shows all the tests in E2E mode. If you want other options, use Cypress UI by adding this script to `package.json` then run it.

```json
"test:open": "cypress open"
```

```bash
npm run test:open
```
